MetaCogAI: A Confidence-Aware Multimodal AI System

MetaCogAI is a powerful AI system that classifies images and text, estimates the confidence behind its predictions, and intelligently fuses results into a meaningful decision. Designed as a research-driven prototype, it bridges computer vision, natural language processing, and human-centric AI introspection.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- âœ… **Multimodal Inference**: Supports both **image** (CIFAR-10) and **text** (IMDb reviews) inputs
- âœ… **Confidence Estimation**: Every output includes a confidence score
- âœ… **Fusion Logic**: A logic-based combination of image + text predictions for higher-level decisions
- âœ… **Logging System**: Tracks predictions and metadata for each session
- âœ… **Interactive UI**: A deep vintage-styled HTML interface with background animation
- âœ… **Self-contained**: Fully local deployment, no external cloud dependencies

 Getting Started

 1. Clone the Repository
clone the repository to your local device.

 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # On Windows

3. Install Required Libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

 4. Run the FastAPI Backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Visit the FastAPI interactive docs at http://127.0.0.1:8000

 5. Launch the Frontend UI
Open index.html in your browser directly. No server needed â€” it's static.

 Testing the System
The UI supports uploading a CIFAR-10-like image and a movie review. Youâ€™ll get:

Image prediction from CIFAR-10 (cat, dog, airplane, etc.)

Text sentiment from IMDb (positive, negative)

Final Fusion Decision based on both

ðŸ–¼ CIFAR-10 Image Classes Used
Label Index	Class Name
0	airplane
1	automobile
2	bird
3	cat
4	deer
5	dog
6	frog
7	horse
8	ship
9	truck

 Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3.10+

PyTorch (image training & inference)

Transformers (HuggingFace) (DistilBERT for text)

FastAPI (backend API)

HTML + JS + CSS (vintage-themed frontend)

Uvicorn (ASGI server)

Datasets from:

CIFAR-10 (image classification)

IMDb (sentiment analysis)

 UI Preview
A modern but vintage-styled interface with interactive background and elegant typefaces.

Upload an image + review â†’ Hit "Predict" â†’ Get predictions and confidence â†’ Fusion Result

 Logging
All predictions (image, text, fusion) are automatically logged via utils/logger.py and can be used for:

Auditing

Meta-analysis

Evaluation of model bias or overconfidence

 Retraining the Models
If needed:
python train_image_model.py   # For CIFAR-10 ResNet
python train_text_model.py    # For IMDb DistilBERT
Outputs are saved to models/.
